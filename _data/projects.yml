    ## Goals
    - Generate custom story-lines based on user input details in the style of Western comics
    - Generate panels (images) with same style, setting and characters of the original comic, but using the custom storyline

    ## Features
    - End-to-end project, from data collection to deployment on my hardware
    - Use of image-text-to-text technology
    - Use of text-to-image technology

    ## Challenges and considerations
    - Must run on consumer hardware
    - Very limited hand-labeled data (to be created by me)
    - Matching original characters behavior in the generated story may be tricky
