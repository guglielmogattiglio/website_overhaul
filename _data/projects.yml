    Custom comics storyline and panel generation matching Western style of Tex Willer comics. 

    
    **Key technologies**
    - test
    - tes
  detail: |
    **Goals** 
    - Generate custom story-lines based on user input in the style of Western comics
    - Generate panels (images) with same style, setting and characters of the original comic, but using the custom storyline

    **Features**
    - End-to-end project, from data collection to deployment on my hardware
    - Use of image-text-to-text technology
    - Use of text-to-image technology

    **Challenges and considerations**
    - Must run on consumer hardware
    - Very limited hand-labeled data (to be created by me)
    - Matching original characters behavior in the generated story may be tricky

    **Work in Progress**: check the link below to find out more!

    **Goals**: Achieve sub-1-second style transformations using a pre-trained feed-forward network.  


    **Challenges**: Balancing speed vs. fidelity, bundling model for CPU fallback.
    **Outcomes**: Working demo with multiple artistic styles.
