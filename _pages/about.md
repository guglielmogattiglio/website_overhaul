I thought about keeping this "About me" page personal, but some professional content managed to sneak in nonetheless... Oh, well!

### Who I am

I think of myself as a creative and a creator, usually buzzing with ideas: coding, DIY, ML & AI, robotics, you name it. A few examples:
- During my bachelor I created a self-hosted python-based platform for hosting Python hackathons. Back then, I co-founded a data science society in my uni (Bocconi), and we were running this python competitions in the university at large to encourage people to learn coding in a friendly environment.
- Across high school and early uni I tinkered quite a bit with Arduino: I was planning a video-surveillance system and a drone. Then, of course, uni happened and I shifted my energies elsewhere.
- As an example of DIY, I built two longbows from scratch in the past. To this day I still wonder how I did it. 

Building the longbows took most of covid and about 3 books on the subject (_The Traditional Bowyer's Bible_), but I was very proud of the result:

Perhaps one day I will post something about it.

But I digress.

I am very active, and I love the outdoors. I enjoy both hiking and climbing, being originally from the Italian Alps, and am working towards a professional mountain guide certification.
