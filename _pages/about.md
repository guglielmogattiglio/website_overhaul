title: "About me"
---


I thought about keeping this "About me" page personal, but some professional content managed to sneak in nonetheless... Oh, well!

I think of myself as a creative and a creator, usually buzzing with ideas: coding, DIY, ML & AI, robotics, you name it. For example, I built a few longbows from scratch in the past. To this day I still wonder how I did it. It took most of covid and about 3 books on the subject (_The Traditional Bowyer's Bible_), perhaps I will post something about it.

But I digress.

I am very active, and I love the outdoors. I enjoy both hiking and climbing, being originally from the Italian Alps, and am working towards a professional mountain guide certification.
